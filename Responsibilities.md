# Kępińska Lab Responsibilities and Mentorship

## General principles

- Your research is important, but your safety and well-being are our top priority.
- If you have workload concerns, it is a joint responsibility of you and the PI (Dr. Kępińska) to find a feasible solution.
- We will work together to either help you manage your workload more effectively or adjust it as needed.

#### Undergraduate expectations:
- Participate in weekly lab meetings
- Prepare for regular progress meetings and a weekly lab document with progress
- Present a short talk of research background and/or results to the lab once a semester
- Be available in the lab/office for a minimum pre-arranged set of hours to facilitate interactions

## Documentation and reproducibility

All lab members (postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates) are expected to maintain comprehensive documentation of their work. This includes:

1. Lab notebook: Maintain a detailed record of all experiments, analyses, and research activities.

2. Data management:
   - Organize data in clear, logical directory structures
   - Use consistent file naming conventions
   - Include metadata files explaining the content and structure of datasets

3. Code documentation:
   - Maintain annotated scripts with clear comments
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes
   - Create detailed README files for each project

4. Methods documentation:
   - Document all methods in sufficient detail to allow reproduction
   - Include information on software versions, parameters used, and any custom settings

5. Reproducibility package:
   - For each project or publication, create a package containing all necessary data, code, and documentation to reproduce results
   - This package should be sufficient for results to be reproducible without additional instructions

6. Regular updates:
   - Provide weekly updates on progress in a shared lab document
   - Prepare for regular progress meetings with summaries of recent work and any challenges encountered

7. Open science practices:
   - Submit manuscripts as preprints when possible
   - Share code and data openly, if possible, in line with ethical and privacy considerations
   - Contribute to the lab's efforts in promoting reproducible research

## Mentorship approach

- I understand that individuals have different preferences for mentorship, ranging from hands-off to very involved.
- Every lab member will be offered a one-on-one progress meeting with me every two weeks or weekly for graduate and undergraduate students.
- I am open to accommodating different preferences on frequency and length of meetings.
- The goal is to help every lab member develop into a self-directed learner who can generate and execute their own ideas.
- We aim for every person to transition from hands-on supervision early on (if that is a preferred style to start with) to more self-directed work over time.

### Support and accommodations

- As a mentor, I aim to provide intellectual, emotional, and financial support.
- Discussions related to motivations for doing science or personal circumstances impacting well-being are welcome.
- I am happy to support you in developing accommodations around health, care-taking/family responsibilities, etc., or in formally requesting accommodations from the university.
- Lab members are not expected to disclose personal details or circumstances unless as required for formal accommodation requests.
- I will provide you with any details that I forward to the university and ask for your feedback to ensure accuracy and protection of your privacy.

## Career development

- Regular discussions on short-term and long-term career goals
- Assistance with identifying opportunities aligned with career objectives
- Support for skill development and networking within chosen career path
- For those interested in academia, guidance on postdoctoral opportunities and faculty positions
- For those exploring non-academic careers, support in identifying and preparing for alternative career paths

## Open science and reproducibility

- Training provided in open science practices and reproducible research
- Emphasis on thorough documentation and sharing of methods and data
- Emphasis on preprint submissions and open-access publishing
- Support for developing skills in data management, version control, and reproducible workflows
