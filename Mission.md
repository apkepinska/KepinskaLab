# The Kępińska Lab

The Kępińska Lab aims to develop algorithms and apply them to genetic and phenotypic big data to understand relationships between biological pathways and psychiatric disorder comorbidities throughout life, with a focus on psychosis. We aim for this work to advance patient, clinician, and researcher knowledge on disorder fluidity and prognosis, to help combat stigma and misperceptions of psychiatric disorders as genetically predetermined and unchangeable, and to lead to timely interventions.

## Our Goals

We will achieve this by:

1. Conducting rigorous research with as many research outputs freely accessible as possible;
2. Integrating epidemiological and genetic approaches to create comprehensive patient trajectories for detailed mechanistic insights.

Our research group will adopt an open science model, making study protocols, data, publications, and teaching materials openly available whenever possible (see [Kępińska et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2023.08.007)).

## Core Values of the Kępińska Lab

- Openness
- Interdisciplinarity
- Transparency and integrity
- Adaptability
- Collaboration over competition
