# Kępińska Lab Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all Kępińska Lab members, visitors, and contributors, regardless of duration of involvement. It outlines expected behaviors and treatment of every individual in the lab to ensure a safe, supportive, respectful environment where all individuals are treated equally.

## Scope
- applies to all lab-related events, lab meetings and presentations, including off-site talks and conferences
- covers all work hours, whether on-site or remote, including communications in a professional capacity

## Zero tolerance for harassment
We maintain a harassment-free environment. We tolerate no harassment related to race, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion (or lack thereof), migration status or background, carer or parent status, class, or academic background. Harassment includes:

- offensive comments or imagery;
- intimidation or stalking;
- deliberate intimidation, including sustained disruption of discussions;
- unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention;
- persistent misgendering or use of non-preferred names/nicknames.

## Reporting and enforcement
- Report any concerns or violations to Dr. Kępińska immediately.
- All reports will be treated confidentially.
- Violators will be approached by Dr. Kępińska immediately, with removal from lab projects for repeated offenses.

## Professional conduct
- Maintain professional communication suitable for diverse audiences (sexual content is never appropriate).
- Treat all individuals politely and with kindness, including any individuals met in a professional context, on-site or off-site. Insults, putting down or ignoring collaborators, junior members of the lab, students, or any individuals at work, including professional non-academic, administrative, or facilities/maintenance staff, is not appropriate (they make our work possible!).
- Use provided chosen names and pronouns.
- Never expect or pressure individuals to disclose personal information or disabilities, unless they share this information with you and explicitly consent to your sharing it.

## Implementation of information on chosen names and pronouns
- Lab documents and meetings will include space for preferred names and pronouns.
- Individuals may update their information at any time without explanation.

By participating in the Kępińska Lab, you agree to abide by this code of conduct.
